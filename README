This repo contains plugins for the Supybot IRC bot (have a look at
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/supybot/>), previously included in the
currently unsupported and unavailable supybot-plugins package, minus
those known to be still maintained (namely Debian, Infobot, Markov, Weather).

Some of the plugins might be broken, some use functionality or API
not available any more (like UrbanDict).

For the other plugins, see (and please let me know if the info is incorrect):
Debian, Infobot, Weather: <http://github.com/jamessan/>
Debian, Infobot, Markov: <http://git.jamessan.com/>
